# CSS Grid & Web-MIDI Demo 
An eponymous (and rather basic) demo of the new CSS grid & Web-MIDI APIs.  Complete with cyberpunk colors.
(Nota Bena, this __only works__ in Google-Chrome due to lack of cross-browser support for Web-MIDI)

### Usage:
open up index.html (all the css and javascript is included already in index.html for convenience)
